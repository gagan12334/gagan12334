## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Gagan Chandra Charagondla. 

You can call me Gagan! 

Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in machine learning and innovative technologies. I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science major at Rutgers University, where Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of AI, data, and intelligent systems.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building machine learning models and experimenting with ideas like large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), neural networks, and other core concepts in modern AI.

I primarily work with Python and also have proficiency in Java and C. Whether it's designing predictive models, working on data-driven projects, or exploring how emerging tech can solve real-world problems, I love learning and building every day.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI debate application where two LLM models debate on a prompt of your choice, with structured rounds and clear summaries. I might also include an audio interface. Iâ€™m also working on creating my own interpreted language called Ripple. Follow me on my journey, and feel free to reach out to talk code or just to connect.
